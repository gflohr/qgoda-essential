[% USE q = Qgoda %]
This theme also contains some rudimentary JavaScript and a bunch of CSS rules jotted down by an obviously lousy web developer.  These files merelye serve as placeholders or starting points for your own improvements.

The JavaScript file `assets/js/site.js` just removes the `no-js` class from the document's `<html>` element.  And you can find the CSS for the theme in `assets/css/styles.css`.  Pull requests for the CSS are always welcome!

If you want to do some serious face-lifting, move on to [% q.anchor(name = 'nodejs') %] and learn how to integrate a state-of-the-art development environment to your Qgoda site.
