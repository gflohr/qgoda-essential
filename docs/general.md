This theme contains examples for most functionality of Qgoda and it also shows
some best practices for organizing a Qgoda powered site.  It does *not* contain
any fancy CSS styling or JavaScript.

The [Qgoda default theme](https://github.com/gflohr/qgoda-default) is a more
comprehensive example of a theme as it also contains a lot of boilerplate
JavaScript and CSS but at the cost of being a lot more opinionated.  But if
you can live with the decisions made for CSS framework and build system, then
[qgoda-default](https://github.com/gflohr/qgoda-default) is probably a better
starting point.

All those that prefer to roll their own version will find everything they
need here:

- a typical [site structure]([% q.llinkPost(name = 'site-structure') %])
- typical template structure
- page listings
- pagination
- smart inclusion of JavaScript and CSS
